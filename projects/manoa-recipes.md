[The Manoa Recipes Project Page.](https://manoarecipes.github.io/)

At the end of ICS 314 (Software Engineering I) at University of Hawaii at Manoa, I was tasked along with three other teammates to create an application aimed at improving the UH community. My team consisted of Michael Serai, Kyle Levesque, and Michael Yoshimura. We decided to write a recipe database application that would feature dorm room recipes and information about local grocery sources within driving range of UH Manoa. We named the application Manoa Recipes.

The application was written in HTML, Javascript, and a minor amount of CSS. We utilized [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) as our javascript platform. Throughout the process, I developed a significant, working understanding of [FlowRouter](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). All the code I wrote was edited and created through [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Most of my work on the project focused on backend development, focusing on processing user data input and database management. The two pages that took up a majority of my time were: 

The user profile page:<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/favorited-recipes.png">

And the add recipe page:<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/add-recipe.png">


Working with a group also helped me to learn how to utilize the various strengths of my teammates to maximize efficiency.

The code is public and may be accessed on the project page, linked at the top of this page, [or directly by clicking here](https://github.com/manoarecipes/manoarecipes).
