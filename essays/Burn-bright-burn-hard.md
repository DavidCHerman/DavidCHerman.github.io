To say that I was blindsided by Meteor wouldn't be fair. We received ample warning about how difficult it was going to be and while that did help to brace me, I didn't quite understand the scope of how lost I would be until much later. I am quite happy to say that now I have a reasonably good idea of how to work through Meteor and I'm very glad to have had this experience.

There was a lot to learn regarding Meteor. During the first few assignments I had very little idea what I was doing. I had a vague idea of how all the individual commands and pages worked together, but everything that I was doing was more or less just me remembering the procedure that I witnessed in the instructions. Of course, I did learn a few things, but when I put together most of the WODs it was a toss up as to how or why the program was doing what I needed it to. In fact, it wasn't until a week and a half in that I actually took the time to look into what Handlebars were and how they functioned in a program. 

Perhaps it was possible for us to take tinier steps in learning about what Meteor did, but I realize now that what we did in Meteor was rather basic. Although there were several different elements working together, the functionality of the web page was simple and the relationships between the different items were about as straightforward as you could get. I'd initially thought that just going through the motions and writing a program that I didn't fully understand would be a waste of time, but after most of the WODs, I would find one or two problems with my code, and it was in the problem solving of that code that I truly began to understand how Meteor worked. Piece by piece I began to understand why I was doing what I had been doing for previous programming exercises, and I think throwing us into the deep end like this was necessary, albeit a bit discouraging at first.

It wasn't until the extra credit assignments that I really started to put all the pieces of Meteor together. In previous assignments our hands were held and we learned what Meteor could do using example code, but by asking us to solve new problems I had to dig deep into why everything acted as it did. I didn't fully appreciate it at first, but the reactivity of Meteor as I'm programming it was a huge help. It's the difference between performing surgery on a living person vs a cadaver. Seeing the response of specific code changes as opposed to large swaths of code changes was invaluable not only to troubleshooting, but to my understanding of how the code worked at all.

Meteor was overwhelming, and only by swallowing my pride and trusting in the lessons was I able to get to where I am now. Oftentimes in programming you won't get to see the big picture. You'll work on small parts interacting with a large project, and you need to keep working until you see the light. Meteor didn't just teach me a new application architecture, it taught me patience and focus.
