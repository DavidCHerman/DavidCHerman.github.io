Ethics does not exist in code. The purity of ones and zeros leaves little room for philosophy. Just like a star being born in the blackness of space, the laws of physic are not inherently good or bad. They only follow a logical course to an inevitable end. Ones and zeros, as well as protons and electrons, can only follow rules. Animals can only follow the course of instinct and learned responses. Arguably, humankind is limited to this as well, but if we are not, we are unique in this universe only in that we have the ability to choose how we view the world. We can see outside of instinct and build our own rules for how we act and respond to the world around us. We have learned how to value outside of ourselves, outside of our families, outside of our species, even to the point of valuing thoughts and abstract concepts more than life. In our cleverness we have gained the ability judge the value of universe and based on that, we act not as a cog within it, but as an architect. Some would call ethics a set of personal rules or laws, but those words are insufficient and make slaves of us all. Ethics are an individuals judgements regarding the value of everything. We each choose our ethics. Even when we adopt them from another person it is a choice to cling to them. In this way, we are responsible, and only in this way are we anything more than a collection of ones and zeros.

This may seem irrelevant or excessive in terms of ethics in software engineering, but I felt it necessary to portray my understanding of the concept of ethics, so that contextually the gravity of the choices made would be understood. If I were to believe that a soul is the only thing unique in a human, then our ethics are nothing less than the building blocks of our soul.
