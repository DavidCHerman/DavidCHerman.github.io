In the beginning, I had quite a few problems with the setup of Meteor on my laptop. I can't go into too much detail about how that came about or why it happened (because to do so would require me to attempt to recreate the event and I'm not willing to go back into that hellscape) so instead I'll just say that the problem seemed to stem from a misunderstanding I had in regards to how I was supposed to get Meteor in the first place.

The problem was entirely due to my not reading the instructions clearly enough and venturing off into the deep blue half-cocked and sure of my own ingenuity. I started off with meteor looking up some blogs about the system and people's personal experience. Then, when it came to downloading meteor, instead of just googling "meteor" I used a link on one of the blog's pages. 

What I understood to be meteor turned out to be something else entirely. I understand my foolishness now, and I find it very embarrassing that I even went down that path. It's like I hopped into a van because a stranger offered to take me to where I was going. I sanitized my computer several times after that, and I'm convinced it wasn't a virus or anything, just a completely different application that I wasn't looking for. It was a pretty big scare though. It was possibly just some sort of Meteor alternative or something more irrelevant. When I finally did download meteor, it was so simple and official looking that I imagined no one else in the class could have gotten things so wrong.

Of course, that story has little to do with Meteor and the lesson there might have been that the internet isn't for everyone, but I still learned a very valuable lesson that I should have learned a decade ago.

My other significant problem came much later on in the Meteor learning process when I was working on digits. I'm still not entirely sure how this problem came about (which seems to be a major theme for many of my programming mishaps). It happened during the first digits WOD. The page wouldn't show itself. I went through the entire project several times, sure that I'd just forgotten to import something vital or maybe that a page referenced something it should have or just some loop or break in the chain that made the program unfeasible. I didn't spend a lot of time doing this, but I spent enough and I was confident enough in my code that I thought it might have something to do with the code I had assumed that I had assumed that I didn't touch. So I went back to the original meteor-application-template file that I downloaded and recopied a lot of things, transferring my code that I was certain about into the new program. Everything worked perfectly. 

I'm not sure, but perhaps I erased something in my fat fingered shortcut fumblings or maybe I just copied over a line too many. In any case, I didn't solve the mystery, but I figured out that instead of searching for a needle in a haystack, sometimes you just need to grab your favorite needles, set that haystack on fire and find yourself a brand new haystack.
