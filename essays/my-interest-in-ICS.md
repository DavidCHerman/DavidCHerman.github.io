What is my interest in ICS? I can answer this question in two possible ways, and I suspect that either answer would suffice. First, the practical. Within ICS I am not yet experienced enough to say for certain where my eventual expertise will lie. I would need to take several classes, gauge my interest and aptitude, and then finally make a decision. Right now though, based on a very vague idea of what's involved, I'm interested in learning more about AI development, specifically in the area of Computer Vision.

I consider myself a practical person. ICS held no romantic appeal for me initially, it was just an area I had an aptitude for that promised a growing pool of profitable opportunities. Furthering that line of logic, within the world of Computer Science, AI is one of the fastest growing and most important fronts. I remember a teacher telling me years ago about the different ages of mankind. There was the industrial age, the atomic age, the information age, just very unofficial titles of periods of times in man's history defined by important invention. It seems likely to me that soon we will enter what will be known as the AI age. The power and potential in Artifial Intelligence is staggering. In the age of information, we have made access to knowledge incredibly convenient. We have weaved a web of information that has enveloped the world, closing the distance between minds and increasing our potential. The limit we face now isn't one of access, but of processing. All the information in the world is of no use to someone without the power to properly apply it or understand it. We need minds faster and greater than our own.

I initially stumbled upon AI as merely a possibly profitable course of study that could provide me with a job. But as I spoke more to professors and students, I became enamoured with what ICS could be. Software engineering can be a way to create helpful applications or create world that can entertain people. But it's also to me the clearest way that life can improve for people, and how humanity can become greater. I want to learn how to develop software, but more than that I want to learn new ways to build this world of numbers and logic, and maybe get a glimpse of how to create a mind in that world that can think for itself.
