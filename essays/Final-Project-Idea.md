The problem: It's common knowledge that many students when they enter college run the risk of gaining the Freshmen 15. Those extra pounds that you gain because suddenly your diet changes and you're not properly monitoring your diet. It's a new environment rife with new responsibilities, and the culinary selections are mostly limited to what the school provides.

The solution: The UHM Calorie Counter would be an application that would provide a database of nutrition facts relevant to the food provided on campus. It would be simple enough to gather the information, and once it's logged into the database, students could create a record of their calorie intake or even make personal calorie or weight-loss goals.

Mockup Pages:
- Public landing page
- Login page
- Personal profile (Calendar, personal goal setting, meal favorites)
- Search page (including restaurants and specific meals)
- Add meals page
- Restaurant page (includes meal selection and general information)
- Admin page (edit existing accounts, add restaurants, add meals)

Case ideas:
- New student arrives at landing page, creates a new profile, creates calorie goal, searches for food, logs it in, adds to favorite meals
- Admin logs in, adds a new restaurant, adds meals to the restaurant
- Existing user logs in, reviews calendar, creates a new meal, logs it.

Beyond the basics
- A warning alert when you're close to or have exceeded a calorie goal including tips and suggestions for alternate foods that would fit the calorie goals.
- Users can add non campus foods to their own personal database.
- Includes prices and include a filter that can help students to filter foods down based on price and calorie count.
