Have you ever gone from driving a manual transmission car to an automatic transmission car? It's disconcerting at first. You had more control previously, but now you suddenly don't. You don't initially trust the automatic transmission, it can't possibly know your mind well enough to know how you like the shifting of the gears to occur. But then times goes on and you eventually forget you ever had an issue with this. You can let your mind wander to other things. You've lost a bit of control, but did you really even need that extra responsibility anyway? This, more or less, is how I feel about Javascript. 

Javascript does so many things for you, it almost feels like I'm being babied or that I have a personal assistant. Everything is close enough to Java so that all of the changes so far feel like nothing more than the change in dialect one might detect when travelling a couple of states away from your home. It at times felt awkward because I kept trying to find ways to specify things that I didn't need to specify, like clarifying a datatype when that never seems to be a necessity. I'm certain as time goes on this will become so natural that going back to java or C++ will feel very inconvenient.

My instinct tells me howevere, that Javascript will have certain drawbacks. When the language assumes things for you, that means that in more complicated programs things might get a bit more jumbled. It's the drawback of intuitive programming. To intuit is to make assumptions based on common or likely occurrance. The issue arises when coding moves into instances of uncommon and unlikely. Other languages I've used were sticklers for specificity. This one isn't and that worries me. Of course I'm sure there are ways around this weakness, but then having to find ways around a weakness means you're doing a little extra work, which eats at the whole benefit of convenience. This is of course just my initial impression. Going back to my metaphor with the car, someone driving to and from work every day would find this convenient. A professional racer however, would want the extra control that comes with being in control of a manual car.

I believe Javascript is ultimately a good programming language. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses. While certain languages come down to preference, Javascript has obvious differences that make it ideal for certain circumstances. I can see why in the fast paced world of web development, Javascript takes to it like a fish in water. I'm glad I'm learning it.

This style of learning Javascript is taking some getting used to. I love that it is very clear on the requirements and assignments, and I support the notion that class is a time for application of things studied at home. Once I fall into the swing of things this should all become second nature and very accessible. I look forward to that.
